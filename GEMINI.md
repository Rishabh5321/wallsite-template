# Gemini Project Configuration: wallsite

This file provides context for the AI assistant to understand the architecture and conventions of the `wallsite` project.

## 1. Project Overview

This is a self-hostable wallpaper gallery project. Its primary goal is to be distributed as a user-friendly GitHub template, allowing others to easily create and deploy their own galleries. The project supports two main deployment methods: a simple Git-based deployment via Vercel/Netlify and an advanced self-hosted deployment via Docker.

## 2. Core Technologies

-   **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ESM), HTML, CSS.
-   **Build Tool:** `esbuild` is used for bundling assets.
-   **Package Manager:** `pnpm`.
-   **Image Processing:** `ImageMagick` is a required dependency for thumbnail generation.
-   **Automation:** GitHub Actions are critical for all automation.
-   **Containerization:** Docker is used for the self-hosting option.

## 3. Key Architectural Concepts

### The Two-Repository System

This project uses two separate repositories to function correctly:

1.  **`wallsite` (This Repository):**
    -   This is the **main development repository** and serves as the **live demo**.
    -   It contains the developer's own wallpapers in the `/src` folder.
    -   It contains all workflows, including the one to publish the Docker image (`publish-docker.yml`) and the one to sync to the template (`sync-template.yml`).

2.  **`wallsite-template` (The User-Facing Template):**
    -   This is the repository that users generate from.
    -   It is **automatically kept in sync** with `wallsite` by the `sync-template.yml` workflow.
    -   **Crucially, its `/src` folder is kept empty** (containing only a placeholder `README.md`).
    -   Its `README.md` is different from the main one and contains deployment instructions for the user.
    -   It only contains the `update-gallery.yml` workflow, as the others are excluded by the sync process.

### Core Automation Workflows

-   **`update-gallery.yml`:** This is the essential workflow for the end-user. It watches for changes in the `/src` directory and runs the `generate_gallery.sh` script to update the gallery data and thumbnails.
-   **`sync-template.yml`:** This workflow runs in the main `wallsite` repo. It copies all relevant files (excluding `/src` and specific developer workflows) to the `wallsite-template` repo to keep it up-to-date.
-   **`publish-docker.yml`:** This workflow runs in the main `wallsite` repo to build and publish the Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

### Dynamic Docker Deployment

The Docker setup is designed for maximum flexibility. It uses a single-stage `Dockerfile` with a custom `docker-entrypoint.sh` script. This architecture ensures that when a user runs the container with their own wallpaper directory mounted to `/app/src`, the gallery is generated **at runtime**. This means any changes to the user's local wallpaper folder are reflected on the next container start, without needing to rebuild the Docker image itself.

## 4. Development Rules & Conventions

-   **Rule 1: Never edit generated files directly.** The `docs/js/gallery-data.js` file and the contents of the `src/thumbnails` directory are generated artifacts. To update them, run the `./scripts/generate_gallery.sh` script.
-   **Rule 2: The template repository is sacred.** Do not make manual changes to the `wallsite-template` repository. All changes must be made in the main `wallsite` repository and will be synced automatically.
-   **Rule 3: The user experience is paramount.** The main `README.md` acts as a "launchpad" directing users to the template. The template's `README.md` provides the actual deployment steps for the user.

## 5. Project Features

### Frontend & User Experience
-   **Hierarchical Folder Navigation**: Users can navigate through nested folders directly in the main gallery view, with a "Back" button for easy traversal.
-   **Dynamic Masonry Grid**: A responsive grid that intelligently arranges wallpapers based on their aspect ratio (portrait, ultrawide).
-   **Performant Image Loading**: Utilizes lazy loading and infinite scroll to ensure a fast and smooth user experience, even with large galleries.
-   **Advanced Lightbox**: A full-featured lightbox for viewing images with keyboard navigation, image preloading, and metadata display (name, resolution, format, folder).
-   **Category Browsing**: A collapsible sidebar with a hierarchical file tree lets users browse wallpapers by category.
-   **Client-Side Search**: Instantly search and filter wallpapers by name.
-   **Advanced Sorting**: Users can sort wallpapers by name, modification date, or resolution.
-   **Favorites System**: Users can mark their favorite wallpapers, which are saved locally in the browser.
-   **Random Discovery**: A "Random" button to discover new wallpapers easily. The initial view is a random assortment of all available wallpapers.
-   **User-Controlled Theme (Dark/Light Mode)**: The UI features a toggle for users to switch between dedicated light and dark modes. The theme also respects the user's system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`). On each page load, a new random color scheme is generated, and the toggle switches between the light and dark variants of that scheme.
-   **Fully Responsive**: The entire interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

### Automation & Deployment
-   **Automatic Gallery Generation**: A highly optimized, parallelized shell script (`generate_gallery.sh`) uses ImageMagick to automatically generate thumbnails and a JSON-like data file for the frontend at high speed.
-   **GitHub Actions Integration**: The `update-gallery.yml` workflow automatically runs the generation script whenever images in the `src` directory are updated.
-   **One-Click Deployment**: Pre-configured for seamless deployment to Vercel and Netlify.
-   **Dynamic Self-Hosting**: A `Dockerfile` and `docker-entrypoint.sh` are provided for easy self-hosting. The container generates all gallery content on startup based on a mounted volume, allowing for dynamic wallpaper management without rebuilding the image.

### Developer Experience
-   **Live Development Server**: A `dev` script (`pnpm run dev`) provides a live-reloading development server powered by `esbuild` for a fast and efficient workflow.
-   **GitHub Template**: Designed to be used as a template, allowing for easy project scaffolding.
-   **Modular Codebase**: The frontend JavaScript is organized into clean, reusable ES modules.
-   **Reproducible Environments**: A `flake.nix` file is included for setting up a consistent development environment using Nix.
-   **Code Quality**: Pre-configured with ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code standards.
