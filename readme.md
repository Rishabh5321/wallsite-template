## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the project's architecture and the relationship between the development repository (`wallsite`) and the user-facing template (`wallsite-template`).

```mermaid

    subgraph Development Repository (wallsite)

        B --> C[Generates Gallery & Assets];

        B --> E{GitHub Actions};
        E --> F[Sync to Template];
        E --> G[Publish Docker Image];
    end

## üöÄ Create Your Own Gallery

Ready to build your own gallery? Click the button below to generate a new repository from the template. You'll get a clean copy of the project with an empty `src` folder, ready for your wallpapers and deployment.

<div align="center" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <a href="https://github.com/Rishabh5321/wallsite-template/generate" style="text-decoration: none;">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Use%20this%20template-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=github" alt="Use this template"/>
  </a>
</div>

After you create your repository, follow the simple deployment instructions in your new repository's `README.md` file.

## üîß Deployment Options

### Vercel & Netlify (Recommended)

For a quick and easy deployment, use Vercel or Netlify. Both platforms offer a seamless Git-based workflow.

1.  **Generate from Template**: Create your own repository using the template.
2.  **Add Wallpapers**: Clone your new repository and add your wallpapers to the `src` directory.
3.  **Import to Vercel/Netlify**: Import your repository into Vercel or Netlify. The project is pre-configured for automatic builds and deployments.

### Self-hosting with Docker

For users who want to host the gallery on their own server, a pre-built Docker image is available.

<div align="center">
    <a href="docker-compose.yml" title="View docker-compose.yml"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white" alt="Docker"/></a>
</div>

1.  **Pull the Docker Image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/rishabh5321/wallsite:latest
    ```

2.  **Run the Container:**
    Run the Docker container, making sure to mount your local `src` directory (filled with your wallpapers) into the container at `/app/src`.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
      -v /path/to/your/wallpapers/src:/app/src \
      --name my-wallsite \
      ghcr.io/rishabh5321/wallsite:latest
    ```
    Your gallery will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
