## âœ¨ Live Gallery

You can view the live wallpaper gallery here: **[Live Gallery](https://Rishabh5321-wallsite.vercel.app/)**

## ðŸ“¥ Adding New Wallpapers

To add a new wallpaper to your gallery:

1.  Enter the Github Repository you creeted using vercel/netify one click deploy.
2.  Add your new image file (e.g., `my-cool-wallpaper.png`) to the `src` directory of your own repository.
3.  Commit and push the changes to your `main` branch.
4.  The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically update the gallery and deploy the changes.

## ðŸŽ¨ How It Works

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the gallery generation process:

1.  **Push to `main`**: When changes are pushed to the `main` branch (e.g., adding a new wallpaper), a workflow is triggered.
2.  **Generate Thumbnails**: The workflow generates smaller thumbnails for each image to ensure the gallery loads quickly.
3.  **Update Gallery**: A shell script (`generate_gallery.sh`) runs to scan for all images and injects the list into the `docs/js/gallery-data.js` file.
4.  **Commit Changes**: The updated `gallery-data.js` is automatically committed back to the repository.
5.  **Deployment**: The site is automatically deployed to Vercel and Netlify when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## ðŸ”§ Final Configuration

After the initial setup, it is recommended to update the repository description to reflect that it is a personal gallery, not the original template.

1.  Go to your repository's main page.
2.  Click the "Edit" button next to the "About" section.
3.  Update the description to something like: "My personal wallpaper gallery."
4.  Click "Save changes".

### Adding a Netlify Status Badge (Optional)

The setup script automatically updates the Vercel status badge. If you have deployed to Netlify, you can add a status badge for it as well:

1.  Go to your site's page on Netlify.
2.  Go to **Site settings > General > Status badges**.
3.  Copy the Markdown snippet for the badge.
4.  Paste it into your `readme.md` file in the "Status" section.
